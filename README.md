## Hello

My name is Emerson Hatina, and I am a
Computer Scientist here at the College
of Wooster. I am currently working towards
a duel degree program with either Case Western 
or Washington University. This is, so I can 
pursue my goals of becoming a Mechanical 
Engineer with a masters in Robotics.
